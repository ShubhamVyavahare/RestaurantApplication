# RestaurantApplication
In this project I have used Angular (for Front-end) and JSON-Server (for Back-end). CRUD operations are performed on restaurant. I have used reactive forms, validations on forms, routing, API calls using service, Header, Footer. Also JSON-Server is useful for back-end tasks (It is going to handle all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations).
